LF Decentralized Trust project maintainers, experienced developers, and active community members will mentor participants, guiding them to complete a mentorship project with a defined scope and outcome. Mentors and mentees will collaborate remotely from their preferred locations, with regular evaluations and feedback provided. Mentees will have the opportunity to showcase their learnings and contributions through blogging, speaking at meetups or regional events, or traveling to a global event to present their work in person and network with the broader community. The mentorship program plays an important role in introducing new talent to the LF Decentralized Trust projects and community, which contributes to maintaining and enhancing the health and sustainability of our open source community. </p>"},{"location":"#benefits-for-mentees","title":"Benefits for Mentees","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Gain exposure to first-hand experience with real-world open source software development</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn to effectively use open source development infrastructure, tooling, and best practices</p> </li> <li> <p>Make an impact on large scale open source projects through code contribution, documentation, or research</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn open source culture and best practices directly from open source professionals</p> </li> <li> <p>Develop close working relationships with open source professionals and industry business leaders to expand professional network</p> </li> <li> <p>Showcase work and raise profile in the decentralized tech space and open source development community in general</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#benefits-for-mentors","title":"Benefits for Mentors","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Defined avenue to share your passion and expertise in open source development and contribution</p> </li> <li> <p>Structured opportunity to teach and guide new contributors towards making productive contributions  </p> </li> <li> <p>Get additional help to address needs and gaps in feature or code development, research, or documentation</p> </li> <li> <p>Nuture the health and sustainability of your project and community by training and and bringing in new talent</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#2025-program-dates","title":"2025 Program Dates","text":"<ul> <li> <p>05 Feb 2025 - 15 Mar 2025 community members submitting mentorship project proposals (please review proposal submission guidelines)</p> </li> <li> <p>17 Mar 2025 - 30 Mar 2025 mentorship project proposal review by Technical Advisory Council (mentors or proposal submitters may be asked to clarify or address questions raised by the TAC)</p> </li> <li> <p>01 Apr 2025 - 10 May 2025 mentee application period on LFX Mentorship</p> </li> <li> <p>12 May 2025 - 23 May 2025 mentee application review and applicant interview</p> </li> <li> <p>26 May 2025 - 30 May 2025 selected mentee notification</p> </li> <li> <p>02 June 2025 - 13 Jun 2025 1<sup>st</sup> two weeks of June onboarding/orientation sessions</p> </li> <li>16 Jun 2025 - 28 Nov 2025 mentee/mentor working period (mentees are expected to commit ~15 hours a week on a consistent basis during this time) </li> <li>25 Aug 2025 - 05 Sep 2025 midterm mentee evaluation and report</li> <li>17 Nov 2025 - 28 Nov 2025  final mentee evaluation and report</li> </ul> <p>Note: The program dates are subject to change.</p>"},{"location":"#funding","title":"Funding","text":"<p>Mentees may be eligible to receive funding for training or other materials needed for the mentorship project.
